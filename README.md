# Human Activity Recognition

## Introduction

This repository contains a Human Activity Recognition (HAR) project that utilizes various datasets, including UCI HAR, Wisdom, and PAMAP2. 
The goal of this project is to recognize and classify human activities based on sensor data using machine learning and deep learning techniques. 
The project incorporates several models, including Logistic Regression, Linear SVC, SVM Classifier, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and deep learning models like Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM).

## Datasets

- **UCI HAR**: The UCI Human Activity Recognition dataset is widely used in HAR research. It contains data from smartphone sensors that capture various activities like walking, standing, and more.

- **Wisdom**: Wisdom dataset is used for HAR and includes sensor data to recognize activities such as running, cycling, and sitting.

- **PAMAP2**: The PAMAP2 dataset consists of sensor data from wearable devices to identify activities like lying, sitting, and more.


## Models

The project employs a variety of machine learning and deep learning models for activity recognition:

- **Logistic Regression**
- **Linear SVC**
- **SVM Classifier**
- **Decision Tree**
- **Random Forest**

- **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)**: A deep learning model known for its ability to model sequences and time-series data.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python and the following libraries installed:

- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-Learn
- TensorFlow (for LSTM)
- Other necessary libraries for data manipulation and visualization

You can install these dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn tensorflow
